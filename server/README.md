# Recipe-Management
Recipe Management System is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose. Users are authenticated using a userAuth middleware, which ensures that each recipe is associated with a specific user through the createdBy field. The request data is validated using a custom recipeValidation() function, and strict field-level validation is enforced for inputs like title, description, category, cuisine, and more. For image handling, you've integrated Cloudinary in a reusable way using a separate cloudinary.js configuration. When a recipe is submitted, the image is uploaded to Cloudinary, and only the resulting image URL is stored in the database under the coverImage field. The API endpoint POST /registerRecipe accepts complete recipe data and saves it efficiently. On the frontend, you can display the stored images simply by using the Cloudinary URL in an <img> tag. This system is structured to be clean, modular, and scalable, and it efficiently offloads image storage while keeping your database lightweight.
